So the structure so far is a bit convoluted. If I have an epiphany (or stop being dense), it might get simpler. So far it is a bit of a mess.

## Order

So this package will depend on rosdop, which will interface with docker. Here we will have the launch files and the reference to the tub that will be mounted and built as necessary.

Rosinstall uses something that is reminiscent of this, so I will start just randomly and as I learn more I will try to integrate with that idea. Hopefully it will make sense in the future.
